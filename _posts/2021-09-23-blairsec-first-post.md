Today marks the first meeting of the 2021-2022 blairsec club year, as well as the beginning of this blog.

Here, you'll find solutions to challenges that we gave the previous week during our club meeting. For example, let's say a challenge given during our club meeting on Thursday leaves you confused and stuck. You can check this blog over the weekend and the intended solution will be on here.

The goal here is to leave enough time to think about a challenge without spoiling it, while also helping those who are stuck in a timely manner.

Also, you'll be able to read any additional comments the captains (or maybe guests!) have to say about a particular lecture.

Lastly, if there are any CTFs that many Blair teams participate in, we'll be sure to proudly announce it here afterwards.

Thanks, and see y'all next meeting!
