Last meeting we learned about how to use GDB, [lecture here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wO8tdnAo7hTpga3Zo35ex5-iu0Mcd7Q6vfEq4duQi2c/edit#slide=id.p).

There were two challenges, which were compiled differently ([`gdb_demo`](#gdb-demo) and [`gdb_demo_harder`](#gdb-demo-harder)).

### gdb demo

You can start gdb by running the command `gdb gdb_demo` in the `/cybersec/rev/gdb_demo` directory.

Let's take a look at the main function:

```

At `main+176`, there is a call to a "decrypt" function, but our input is not being used in the call to it. So the decrypt function is probably going to be somewhat related to the flag. We can break at `main+181` by typing in `break * 0x0000000000401422` or with `break * main+181`. Note that this challenge was compiled without PIE enabled, so that means we can break directly at the address (`0x0000000000401422`) and not worry about it changing between runs.

When we run the program with `r` and we get to the breakpoint we set, we can see the flag in the registers! Due to how Jason wrote this code it was conveniently located at the end of the stack frame.

Flag: `flag{reading_your_mind_with_gdb}`

### gdb demo harder

Now, our executable has a couple of changes. First, there are no debug symbols. This means we can't `break *main+<whatever>` or even `disass main` because when compiling, those names were thrown out. Now they are all just memory addresses.

Second, PIE is enabled. This means that memory addresses for instructions are relative only to each other, and are loaded at a random base every run. GDB can partially solve this by always loading the binary at some fixed address, typically with a bunch of `0x55555555`s at the beginning, like `0x0000555555554000`. This can be toggled with the command `set disable-randomization [on/off]` with GEF.

Not gonna lie I don't really know if this is the best way to do it but this is how I did it.

I first ran the program with `r`. The program waits for input so I decided to hit `ctrl-c` to interrupt the program. Because the program is reading input, I know that at some point the actual code has a call to a function that reads input. So if I interrupt and get a backtrace with `bt`, I can probably figure out where the calling function is:

![backtrace.png](/writeups/assets/images/01-27-22/backtrace.png)

In this case, `0x00005555555550b4` looks pretty promising. It was entered into by `__libc_start_main`, which happens to be the function that calls the `main` function in executables that use libc, which is pretty much everything.

Taking a look at the raw instructions starting from `0x00005555555550b4`, it looks kind of like the `gdb demo` program we did earlier. Playing around with `ni` and `si` leads to the conclusion that `call   0x555555555360` calls the `decrypt` function and right after the flag is on the stack. So we want to break at `0x5555555550f3`.

Sure enough, our flag is there:

![registers2.png](/writeups/assets/images/01-27-22/registers2.png)

Flag: `flag{reading_your_mind_with_gdb}`

Note that the flags are the same because the code compiled for the program is literally the exact same, but the two were compiled differently.

See you at the next meeting!
